        - "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." (Pride and Prejudice)
        - "The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid." (Northanger Abbey)
        - "I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library." (Pride and Prejudice)
        - "Our scars make us know that our past was for real." (Persuasion)
        - "There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature." (Northanger Abbey)
